Key Takeaways:

1. The mood in Israel after October 7, following the war and ongoing conflict, was characterized by shock, speechlessness, and a sense of being abandoned by their own authorities. The ongoing trauma and the feeling of being against the world have created a complex and difficult environment for Israelis.

2. The support for Hamas among Palestinian citizens of Israel was not as high as initially perceived, and many were horrified by the brutality and atrocities committed by Hamas during the conflict. The shock and confusion among Palestinian citizens of Israel led to a more complex emotional response, and the strict response of the police and arrests also contributed to the attitudes in that community.

3. Public opinion in Gaza before October 7 showed a decline in support for Hamas due to the difficult economic situation and lack of progress towards Palestinian statehood or liberation from Israeli control. However, the ongoing conflict and the rally effect during wartime led to an increase in support for Hamas.

4. The effectiveness of the Israeli blockade in Gaza was called into question after the conflict, as it was revealed that Hamas was able to arm itself despite the restrictions. The presence of wealth in Gaza, alongside the weaponry, raised doubts about the impact of the blockade.

5. The desired endpoint for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a traditional two-state solution to a confederated approach, allowing for more open and porous boundaries between the two states while maintaining national self-determination claims for both sides.

6. The concern about religious fundamentalism and theocratic influence in both Israeli and Palestinian societies is acknowledged, and the need for shared concepts of human rights and democratic institutions to counteract extremism is emphasized.

7. The discussion of what makes Israel a Jewish state and the need for a balance between Jewish identity and democratic values is highlighted, with an emphasis on inclusivity and equality for all citizens.

8. The optimism for the future of Israeli society is rooted in the resilience and solidarity demonstrated by civil society during and after the conflict, despite ongoing political disputes. However, the outlook for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains less optimistic, with the recognition that Israel's promise of being a democracy is tied to the resolution of the conflict and the freedom of the Palestinian people.
