In this podcast, neuroscientist and author Robert Sapolsky discusses his book "Determined: The Science of Life Without Free Will" with host Russ Roberts. Sapolsky argues that there is no free will and that human behavior is predetermined by a combination of biological and environmental factors. He explains that our actions are influenced by a wide range of factors, including genetics, brain structure, hormonal levels, cultural upbringing, and past experiences. Sapolsky emphasizes that the belief in free will leads to blame, judgment, and punishment, which can be detrimental to society. He suggests that accepting the absence of free will can lead to a more compassionate and understanding approach to human behavior. While he acknowledges the complexity of human consciousness and the limitations of predicting individual behavior, he maintains that the absence of free will does not imply chaos or unpredictability.
