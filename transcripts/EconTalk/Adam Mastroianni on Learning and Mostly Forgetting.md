Welcome to EconTalk Conversations for the curious part of the Library of Economics and Liberty. I'm your host, Russ Roberts of Shalem College in Jerusalem and Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Go to econtalk.org, where you can subscribe, comment on this episode, and find links and other information related to today's conversation. You'll also find our archives with every episode we've done going back to 2006. Our email address is mail@econtalk.org we'd love to hear from you. Today is September 13, 2023, and my guest is psychologist Adamastriani. His substac is experimental history. I encourage you to read it. It is phenomenal. This is his third appearance on Econ Talk. He was last here recently, in August of 2023, talking about how you can't reach the brain through the ears. That is how hard it is to tell someone something and then for them to remember it, absorb it, and apply it. Today's conversation is a sequel, and maybe also a prequel. We're going to continue to talk about learning and the acquisition of wisdom and understanding based on some other writing you've done, Adam. And whatever we get to, we'll link to, but we're going to start with an essay you wrote called you'll Forget most of what you learn. What should you do about that? Adam, welcome back to EconTalk. Hey, thanks for having me back. It's good to see you again. Good to see you. Let's talk about formal education, what we call the classroom. As you start in your essay, most of us spend years there. Do we really forget most of what we heard? Most. In fact, almost all, maybe all. Yeah. You could answer this question a few different ways. Right? So people have done some studies on this where they try to do the formal thing and track the things that people are supposed to learn in their classes and then follow up with them the years later. And you can get pretty much every number you want, depending on how long you wait, how you do the test. But it's somewhere between a lot of what people learn, they lose, and pretty much everything. And I mean, you can run this test on yourself, right? Like, I graduated from college in 2014, and as just a little test, I tried to list every class that I took. I knew that there were 32 because I took four every semester, and I got to 19 out of the 32. And so if I can't even name a good chunk of the classes that I took less than ten years ago, maybe that knowledge is accessible in a different way, but clearly it's not very accessible. And the other example I have of this was just happening upon an episode of Are you smarter than a fifth grader? Where a woman, to the dismay of all the fifth graders on stage is screaming over and over, there are 352ft in a yard. So it's bleak. Whatever the number is, it's not a great one. One answer to that, and it was the answer I used to give. It's interesting. I think as an economist with the free market bent, most of my life I had trouble, still have a little bit of trouble, but I certainly had trouble when I was younger, accepting that really horribly stupid, irrational things would persist. Figured people would usually figure things out and make them better. So the idea that we would spend twelve to 16 years in a classroom and get, quote, almost nothing out of it seemed improbable to me. It still does a little bit. So I'm going to defend it a little bit. But I'm very sympathetic to your point. Now that I'm older, one argument would be, well, okay, you don't remember facts, right? I don't remember atomic weight. I don't remember exactly what the red shift is. I know it has something to do with speed of things and their frequencies changing, but that's not really what those are, just facts. They're not important. I can Google those or look them up in a book. What's important are modes of thinking. And that's what I learned in school. I learned how to think, or I learned frameworks for thinking, and that's what I learned. And that's more important than facts. Yeah. Well, I think two problems with that. One is it does really seem that what we're doing a lot of the time in the classroom is trying to transmit the facts. That if you went into a classroom and they were like, look, we know you're not going to remember any of the facts here and you can look them up anyway. What we're really going to do is teach how to think. I go like, okay. But there doesn't seem to be a point at which the teaching to think actually happens. I know that this is the conceit behind higher education. The example I use in the piece is, if you want to learn how to learn, we do actually know something about how to learn, and it is nothing like we get people to learn in undergrad. So, for instance, all of the things that people naturally do to try to remember things better, highlight things in their textbooks, take bullet pointed notes, rereading things, there's pretty good evidence that doesn't help you remember those things. Certainly cramming doesn't help you remember most of the incentives that we create for people, encourage them to cram for the test, take the test, and then don't remember anything afterward. So if that is what we're doing, which I agree we're doing some of, but it doesn't seem to really be what we're trying to do, and it doesn't seem to be what we mainly do. So here at Shalom College, we do for the first year or so of the students experience, read great books in small seminars and explore them. And I do think besides finding out what happened in the Odyssey, I do think students acquire insights into themselves and learn how to read from that experience, which is much more important than knowing what happened to Odysseus when he encountered the sirens. So I think there's some of it, but I certainly agree with you that let's call it the lecturing format. I was a very interactive lecturer, but still I lectured. I think the lecturing format is pretty dismal in being transformative. And I think back to my college astronomy class, I don't remember one thing from it. It doesn't mean I got nothing out of it, but I don't remember one thing. And that's really weird because I love the nighttime sky. And One of the things I've learned since I took my astronomy class, unless I learned it and forgot it, is that when you look up at the nighttime sky in a decent place, meaning not too much light pollution, and you see thousands of stars, virtually every, and in most cases every star that you see is in the Milky Way. That's extraordinary. When I learned that fact, and I learned it about six years ago from a friend of my nephew who was staying with us for a night in a place with really good stars, he just mentioned that. Not fanned away, I thought, well, that can't be true. I know that, but I didn't know it, and I think it is true. And the only exception is that maybe there's like, I think it's Andromeda you can kind of see as a sort of smudge with the naked eye, but every single star you see is from the Milky Way, which means that you are seeing 1300,000,000,000th at most of the stars in the universe. And to me, that's a mind boggling thing. And I hope maybe for some of our listeners that would be the only thing they take away from our conversation. Adam probably not. But is that not extraordinary? And why would I not want to know that in college, unless I knew it, was told it, forgot it, and when I got older and heard it, I was in a better place. I was more interested. Very possible. But it is remarkable that I literally cannot name one thing I learned. Yeah. And I think the important part of that fact isn't necessarily like that particular ratio, or even necessarily that every star you see is in the Milky Way. I think the important thing to take away from it is you are very small. And the things that you can see are a very tiny sliver of all the things that exist. And putting the numbers and the facts to it help access that experience. But I think it is that thing that is quite important, and it probably helps if you receive that knowledge as you are looking at the stars. There's a reason why that feeling tends to arise when we are able to do that, and why I feel like I can access a little bit of what you're talking about, this feeling of being very small, when you just describe it to me. But right now I feel kind of big. I'm in a room where I own all the stuff in it, and I kind of feel like I'm the center of the universe. I live in a city, and so I don't feel all that small at all. And so it's not even really. The fact is a handle that's bolted onto the thing that we really want to get, which is this knowledge of being very small. Maybe knowledge isn't even the right word for it. Or a feeling of awe, a feeling of wonder. Yeah. I'm going to give one more example, though, and I want you to react to it because I think it's sort of interesting. I think it was third grade, might have been fifth. Somewhere in between third and fifth grade, we had to do an assignment on Greece, the country, mostly ancient Greece. So some people did the culture, some one person did I don't know what. Different history, different pieces of it. And one of my classmates, whose name, of course, I've forgotten, but I do remember his report vividly. He was assigned Greek military history. And his entire report was one sentence, Greece. Well, maybe two. Greece has been in many wars, too many to talk about right now. He sat down. It's a great speech. It's a great presentation, and remarkably memorable. Now, I want you to respond to that, because it's the only thing I remember pretty much from that class or maybe the whole year. And why do I remember that? It's funny. I've told it dozens of times. I've repeated it. So jokes and stories we do often remember, not deep understanding, wisdom and so on. And I think that's important. Yeah. And there's probably so much to that story that I'm assuming that, you know, that I don't know. Right. That kid could have been the class clown. He could have been self aware about this. So it's not clear to me from the story whether he was self aware or whether he was sort of a savant, like a child beyond his years, or whether, I think you said he. I was just assuming it was a boy in my memory, or whether he was just really just phoning it in and didn't even realize that. That was a very silly thing to say. I have a similar story from social studies class in 9th grade or something. We were talking about the Treaty of Versailles, and we were reading out of the textbook. I think we were going through the room and each of us was like, reading a paragraph. And this kid Isaac had to read the first time we encountered the word Versailles. And he said is, I grew up in Ohio. There is a town where people, they don't say Versailles, but they do say. And like, we stopped and everybody laughed at him. And I remember years later, people would talk about Versailles. And so I'm embarrassed to say this, I can't even tell you which war it was that the Treaty of Versailles ended, but I do know what it was like for this guy to be ridiculed in front of his classmates for mispronouncing it, which I don't think was the thing that our teacher hoped that we kept with us 20 years later. Let's then go to the next part of your insight. I think it's a reality. There have been a number of tests in economics of this. I used to be skeptical of them, and I'm not anymore. How little people remember of microeconomic theory, say, after the course is over. And I think Robert Frank on this program made the observation that months, if it's far enough, after the course is over, people who haven't taken the class do as well as people who took the class, should be a very good measure of how bad learning is. Let's assume it's true. Despite that, you have something positive to say about the learning that we experience. What is it? So it isn't the case that we lose everything. And I think what remains is really interesting, and it seems to remain for a long time, even without really using it, doing all the things that we normally do to keep memories strong. I mean, we just told two stories from our childhoods that you said you've told yours before. I don't know if I've ever told that story before, but it was very accessible to me. And so what was it in those stories? And what is it in the memories that remain? Like, what are those? And what I call them in the piece is vibes, for lack of better word, which is somewhere between implicit and explicit memory. It is some sort of mixture of feelings. It is also, I think, sort of propositional knowledge that can express, but not very easily. And so what was the vibes of seeing that kid mispronounce versailles and be ridiculed? Well, I learned things like, you better be really careful in front of your peers and don't do anything stupid, because it will follow you for a long time. That can happen at any time. I learned that something totally arbitrary could lose you esteem among your peers. None of this had anything to do with what we were supposed to be learning at the time. Another thing that comes to mind, when you mentioned remembering microeconomics, I took a macro class my freshman year of college. I don't really remember anything about the class except for there was a day at the end when she showed us slides from her trip to China, and students started walking out and she said she was, I'm going to test you on. So I learned something important about what it takes to retain people's knowledge and build a moment inside a classroom. I learned something about the arbitrariness of knowledge. Right. That the thing that she had to resort to was sort of this cudgel of, you have to sit and listen to basically me telling you about my vacation, because I can test you on it. None of these things have anything to do with macroeconomics. I can't tell you anything about it, but I think those things are best described as vibes. Fortunately, as the host of the show, I don't have to reveal what I remember about macroeconomics. I think it's greater than your knowledge, but I don't want to go any further than that. Any further than that. This is awkward. I want to disagree with you a little bit, and it's your essay, so you can maybe misunderstand it. I think the things that you're talking about that remain, I think you're trying to salvage the classroom by saying you did learn something. Maybe it's enough to say you felt something. And I want to suggest the possibility that much of life, our experiences, of course, they have lessons. Many of our experiences produce lessons. Don't mispronounce words. Don't say words that you're not 100% sure of. But I think it's more than that. A lot more than that. And it's about that much of life isn't the things we learn, but it's the things we feel. Now, as academics, that's very disturbing. We don't like it. And you refer to that at times in your piece in a different essay we might get to today. But isn't the lesson here that much of life is how we experience things rather than the content? And that maybe that's okay, but it's definitely not the alleged purpose of formal classroom learning. Yeah, no, I think we're in agreement on this. I think because the word feel does a lot of work usually. I think we assume when we're talking about I felt something, we assume that means an emotion. And obviously emotion is part of this. But it isn't just that I felt sad at this time. When we say that word feel, what we really mean is I had some kind of experience that is difficult to articulate. And so emotions are part of that, but they're not all of that. Like when I saw that professor losing the classroom, I did feel something like secondhand anxiety. I felt sympathy. But I think those feelings were like my brain's way of telling me, pay attention to this moment. Something important is happening, and that's why we're going to encode it. And so those emotions are almost like tags in a filing cabinet that allow you to find it again. Yeah, I agree. I don't have any hope of salvaging the classroom in particular, but I do think these things can happen there, and I think they can happen more if you appreciate that those are the things that are much more likely to make it beyond the few months after your class that I effortlessly remembered that experience years later without ever having being tested on it. No one ever told me I was going to be tested on it. Something about it made it stick, and I do think it was a feeling. So you give an example of what you call Bad Vibes and good Vibes from your PsyChology education, which is both amusing and, I thought, Informative. So give us the example of the bad vibe. The Opening moments of One psychology Class and a different One, a good one. Yeah, the bad Vibes were in a cognitive psychology Class. I took that I remember Vividly. In the first lecture, the professor said, cognitive PsyChology is pretty boring. And the bottom fell out of my stomach because I went, oh no, I have to take this Class. It turned out to be pretty boring because he felt that way about it. I do remember that. But as I point out in the essay, there is something I really remember well from that class, which is the concept of Grebels, which are like weird little alien formations that were used to settle, or try to settle a debate in cognitive psychology and neuroscience about, like, what is this patch of brain that we call the fusiform face area that seems to light up in response to faces? Is it specific to faces, or is it actually for processing, like, fine configural Details? And so they made these little alien Creatures they called Grebels. They trained people to distinguish between them, and then found that the fusiform face area also responds to Grebels as well as faces, after you acquainted yourself with them, obviously, the problem here being that, well, the Grebels kind of have faces, and that's worth at least some healthy fraction of $60,000 for the tuition you paid for that class. The Tragedy of that Story Is that you remember two things. One, an really inexcusable, unprofessional Opening Remark by a Faculty member. And two, a phenomenon that is really not that interesting. It's not a transformative experience, but you have a good one. Yeah, the good vibes were a different psychology class I took. It was Psych 101. And the professor, his name was Danny Oppenheimer, he stood up at the front of the class, and he had this whole routine that was all based around a bag of Eminems. I don't remember the whole routine, but I remember the fact of the routine, parts of which included getting somebody to stand up. And he's like, okay, I'm going to talk to the bag of M and MS and tosses it to the student. The student catches it, and he's explaining that what the brain has to do in order to coordinate the body in order to capture the M and MS, is pretty amazing. You have to be able to tell the difference between where the bag of the M and MS is and the rest of the world around it. This is not a trivial computational problem to solve. You have to coordinate your limbs to put your hands in the right position to catch it. I was like, oh, this is all pretty cool. Like, this guy's throwing Eminems at students. That's kind of neat. He tells the student to toss the bag back to him. He catches. He goes, obedience. That's also something that we'll catch in this class. Now the student's a little embarrassed. Everybody's laughing. I'm getting goosebumps even just thinking about it. I was like, oh, this is kind of fun. And then he tosses the Eminems back to the student and he says, okay, now toss it back to me. And the student doesn't do anything. And he goes, learning. We'll also talk about that. And I go, oh, he predicted what the student would do. And it did make me feel a little bit like maybe there is something to the psychology thing, if you could do this with it. And the rest of the semester felt that way. I remember weeping at the end of the semester, just at the beauty and the amount of knowledge that I felt like I had encountered. Not that I could remember all of it afterward, but there's a reason why I became a psychologist, that I kept chasing that feeling that I had, that there were interesting things to discover here and we could do cool things with them. So those were some good vibes. And you mentioned in your essay that even though we had this delightful interaction, experiential moment with the student in the opening lecture, the rest of the class was just him at two X telling you stuff. Yes. And it was sufficiently interesting that it was that powerful that it made you weep when it was over. Do you really think that's all you got out of it was that feeling, though? I do think that because it was my major and I stayed in the field, there's probably more that I remember from that class because I kept using it. So it's not zero. It's definitely not zero. I don't know if it's a very high percentage. And it's not. Sorry, go ahead. No, but my point is, the fact you can't remember it is not that decisive. Yes, maybe you used it in other ways and your brain retained certain patterns that matter. Maybe, yeah. But for the amount of time and attention that I paid to that class at the time, it doesn't feel like a great ratio. I do think this ultimately makes sense. There is something there, right? I'm glad that I took that class. It changed my life. But at the time, when you're in it, it feels like what you're doing is assembling all this house of cards, of facts and knowledge that then topples over afterward, rather than trying to optimize for the things that stick around much later, or at least teaching in such a way where you realize that the point of this cannot be that at the end of this, we administered to you a multiple choice test. And we hope you get like 95% of the questions right. And then we hope that ten years later you would still get most of the questions right. That if you're doing that, I think you're wasting your time. So let me try a different take on this. I lived with my parents for 18 years and then some summers. The 18 years was full time. There were some times where I was asleep. There were times when my dad was on a trip. There's times my mom was on a trip but spent a lot of hours together. I don't remember very many of them. I really don't. I remember more than I can say. Every once in a while a memory will arise that I had forgotten, whatever that means that I couldn't consciously bring to mind. But when we think of the quantity of hours, let's just talk about the 4 hours at night for 18 years. It's thousands of hours where my brain has very little direct recall, and yet I'm pretty confident they shaped me. I want to say two things, actually. One is most of what I do remember is vibe. I remember that they cared for me probably more than I remember the content of what they wanted me to absorb. But my dad was very much a teacher. He was an amateur teacher, but he loved teaching me things. And I don't think I remember very many of them. But I do remember that vibe. And I wouldn't want to say I don't think that even though I can't remember them, they probably didn't. I don't want to say they didn't have much impact. So I'm torn. I find your argument profound and there's more to say. We're going to get to it in a minute, but I wonder if you protest too much. Yeah, I think it comes down to what is it that we hope to do, and are we doing that or not? That if what your father hoped, and if what my psych 101 professor had hoped is that we really got the multiple choice question knowledge at the end of it, I think their hopes were misplaced, but that might not have been what they actually hoped. And in fact, I sent my professor this essay and he largely agreed that the point of that class wasn't that at the end of it, I can tell you what the fundamental attribution error is, or I know what the cerebrum does. It was to understand at a deeper level what psychology is about, that it is possible to ask and answer Questions about the human mind and some sense of how that's done. And that does touch plenty of explicit knowledge. Right. I should be able to tell you some things, and I am able to tell you some things, but what I really should be able to do is I don't know what I'm able to do. What really should happen to me is that I come away going, there's something interesting and important here. Some of my theories of the world are constrained. I know some things not to be true. I know a few things to be true. And I have a better sense of how One might go about doing the business of psychology. That is what I ended up doing the rest of my life. And so I think maybe the hope is similar for a parent that, yes, maybe when they teach you how to change a tire, they really do hope that you remember how to change the tire the next time you have a flat tire. But I think any parent's hope is exactly what you described, which is you knew that you were cared for. And beyond that, whether you know the proper way to descale a bathtub or the correct amount of water to give a certain kind of plant, these things are so much further down the priorities list that in the moment, we hope that people remember these, but we hope that they remember the lesson behind the lesson, which is that there is a certain way of living that is good, and there is a certain way that this person feels about you, which is also good. I'm sure I'm going to fall in the same trap when I'm a father of. Like, I really hope that they remember all the specific things, but obviously I hope they remember the thing behind the. I'm going to read a quote, a beautiful quote from the piece where you tried to describe what you're trying to describe. Adam. I think you're really interested in that challenge. How hard is to describe the things you want to describe? You say quote. So far, I've used the word feelings to describe these indelible, ineffable memories. That implies that these memories are all about emotions. And no doubt, emotions are part of them. But there's even more than that. It's hard to describe, but the transition of winter into spring, seeing the Statue of Liberty in person for the first time, the phase shift that happens when you enter a dance party, the last day of camp, being at a wedding, that probably shouldn't happen. I'm sure these are all about images and emotions, but there's something underneath it all, binding it all together. That's what I mean by feeling. A combination of emotions, aesthetics, meaning, and values. And when you layer feelings on top of each other, you get a vibe. It's a silly word, but it's the only one that fits. End of quote. You want to say some more things about that, or try to. I know it's hard to put into words, you did a lovely job trying there. Yeah, I don't know if I could do any better than that. I think there is a thing there. When I say something like the transition of summer into fall, I think it evokes. I mean, for me, anyway, it evokes something. It evokes like, school is coming, change is happening. I used to talk about this with my sister when we were a kid, that fall felt a certain way. And when we say felt, it wasn't exactly emotions, right? There's emotions in there. Some of it is trepidation and excitement for school, but it really was more like, there's a way that is fall, and when you're not in it, you don't feel it. Man, it is really hard to describe this thing, but I certainly hope the people listening also, they go like, yeah, I guess you only wouldn't get it if you didn't live in a place where you didn't have fall. Yeah, and it's got a smell. I can smell fall. If you say, does fall have a smell? All of a sudden, without conscious effort, I can smell burning leaves. I can smell a pile of leaves. The air feels different. Actually, I think the philosophical term for this is qualia, which is a phrase I often struggle with what its actual meaning is. It's the full range of how we are conscious of things. The other thing I would just mention, as I was trying to get at earlier, I didn't say it very well about experience. Most of the great conversations I've had in my life were not about what I learned from them. There are many conversations. I've learned interesting things. This is one of them. I'm sure that I will learn something from talking to you for an hour. But most of what I love and remember about conversations is how they make me feel. And most of them don't make me feel anything, which is a tragedy. But there's a handful that were profound, and it's not because, oh, I learned something really important. It's because I connected to another human being and deeply, and that is a huge part of life that just. It's outside of learning. And I think a lot of what you're capturing about what we actually remember from the classroom is that level of, it's an intimacy. It's not with another human being. It's with a field, a discipline, a subject matter that you could feel your brain working, that you felt alive. Intellectually, those are profound, but they're not content. Yeah, psychology is a way, and economics is a way. And sometimes interacting with economists, it's hard to articulate, but I can feel it is a different way than psychology is a way that there are some differences in values. I think we could articulate that if you give a talk in front of economists, you're much more likely to be interrupted and you're more likely to get criticized. Whereas psychologists, we sit patiently until the end of the talk, and then we say, thank you so much for your terrific talk, and then maybe we ask some challenging questions. But I think that small cultural difference is the mere filing cabinet tag on top of many deep differences. That's not a superficial difference. I think that is connected somehow to the differences in the way that we go about doing what we do in a way that I don't know enough about economics to know how it's different there. But, yeah, I think that's 100% true. And I think one of my children says that what you study in college is your favorite way of looking at the world. You study science, you look at the world a particular way. You study psychology, you look at a particular way, economics, and they're all different. And you tend to organize the chaos of the facts and causal mechanisms that you encounter through that framework. And if you do it long enough, you forget that it's not the only one. And that's very powerful because it opens many doors you would not be able to otherwise open, but it closes off other doors that you will not be able to open because you have such a narrow tool. Yeah. To what you said earlier about the way things make you feel it. I thought about this in the moment. Forgot it. One of the quotes I have in the piece is this quote that I think is very powerful and good, which is people may not always remember what you say, but they'll always remember the way you make you feel. And what I think is so funny about that quote is no one remembers who said it. It is sometimes attributed to Maya Antalu. But I looked at some of the etymology of this quote, and no one really knows where it comes from. It comes up, but I think the quote itself is the thing that it is describing. Right. No one remembers who says this thing. But you do remember that quote, because it does make you feel a certain way, because you know it to be true, that there are ways that people made you feel. There's a way that a field made you feel. The reason I remained a psychologist was because it made me feel a certain way that the affordances that it presented to me were ones that I knew how to grasp, and they felt good in my hands when I grasped them, and it felt like I could move around reality with the handles that it gave me. And that was a feeling. And I think you're totally right that you get very used to those handles and you stop seeing other handles that didn't fit your hands as well. And so now I can only think in the kinds of experiments you would run to answer questions psychologically. And I don't think in terms of anything else that you could do that I've been given 32 different types of hammer and no screwdrivers, which is okay. I think there are plenty of nails in the world to hit, and other people will have their screwdrivers and they'll drive them. You don't have to have all the tools yourself, but that is the thing that goes away. I come back to that quote, that unattributed unknown quote. People won't remember what you said. If that statement is true. Let's pretend it's literally true. People don't remember your words, but they remember how you made them feel. It should change how you conduct a conversation, shouldn't it? Yeah, I think because what happens is the person comes away with experiencing sort of the emergent property of you, and that property is, of course, made out of some of the things that you say. And so it does make sense to try to say things well. But just like the thing that you take from the class is not going to be the answers to the multiple choice questions. The thing that the person takes from Interacting with you is not going to be the transcript of your conversation that will be part of it. That's in the collection that remains in their head afterward. But it's not all of it. It is also the vibe that they got. And I can remember situations where the vibe that I got was, I'm not really welcome in this conversation, even if the words don't say that. Or where the vibe I got was like, the world is full of possibilities and we need to chase after them and grasp them. I have a friend of mine that is the way that I feel when I talk to him, and that's why I love talking to him. Yeah, I don't know if we think about this all that much. This is fun because I'm going to say it behooves us to think about it. A word I rarely get to use, and often use, is an example of word that's dying out without anyone's control. But it's hanging on because it does have the occasional use. I may have told the story before I apologize to listeners. Maybe you've heard it, but friend of mine has told me that he was in graduate school in economics. He's at a picnic with a bunch of people, and the minimum wage came up, and he's an economist. Other people were not economists. And he said, the minimum wage doesn't, it's not really a good thing because it reduces employment opportunities for low skill workers. And he told me later, I said, how'd that go over? He said, they edged away from me on the blanket. And as a so called rational economist, I always found that offensive. Like, come on, that's not nice. Why wouldn't you engage? Why wouldn't you ever say in response to that? And I've had many moments like that in my life, I've talked about as I'm on the program, but why would the other person say, oh, that's interesting. I've never thought of that. That's not what they say. Almost no one says that. In fact, almost no one ever says, oh, I always thought the minimum wage was good. But you're an economist, so you should know more about than I do. So I guess I've been wrong all my life. That never happens. They never even say, wow, how would that work? Is that possible, or is there evidence for that? They edge away from you on the blanket, folks, and that's because they're not hearing the words. To the extent they're hearing them. They're hearing a threat. Not just a threat. I don't agree with you. A threat that says I'm not a nice person. That's what they heard. They heard an announcement. He should have put a card around his neck. Stay away. I am not a nice person. I don't have a caring heart. That's what they heard. And I think, well, anyway, your turn. Yeah, the vibe of that sentence, I think, to most people is, I don't care about poor people. Like, let them starve. Which is why if you want to have a discussion about that, you have to begin by giving up good vibes and going like, look, we all agree that what we would like is for people who work, including low skilled, undesirable jobs, that they can make a decent living, that allows them to live a good life. Now, we might think that the best way to do that is to make it illegal to pay them below a certain amount of money. That makes total intuitive sense. But I have some evidence, or there's a lot of evidence that doesn't actually get us the end that we want. This is actually, I've run some studies on people being able to convince one another. And one of the issues that we work on is minimum wage. And we ask people, is there anything that could change your mind about these issues? And so some of them are like abortion or gun control. And often people say, no, there's nothing but minimum wage is one where people say, if you could show me that it doesn't actually get the thing that I want to get, I would change my mind on it. Now, whether that's actually true or not is a separate issue, but I think this is one where if you can get the vibes right, I think people might actually be able to receive the data itself. This is tough for me, too, because it feels so intuitively right. We should just make it illegal to do the thing that we don't want. And the idea that we're going to allow people to do whatever they want feels like. But no, that doesn't get us what we want. You have to make it mandatory. One of the great advantages of a decent economics class is that even if you don't remember anything in particular, you might remember that there is an occasional unintended consequence of a well intentioned regulation or law piece of legislation. That's a powerful thing. That's a great thing to have in your mental toolbox. So, again, I'm a little bit skeptical of the fact that we learn that it's mostly vibes. I think there are some metal lessons we learn even if we can't articulate them well. But I want to come back. Let me make that point in a different way. So, famous example of unintended consequences. The city has too many snakes, so they put a bounty on snakes. And if you bring a snake to the snake office, you get paid, you get a reward. So the idea is, oh, people will go out and trap snakes and we'll have fewer of them. Of course, if you pick the wrong amount, people will raise snakes, and that would be defeating the purpose of the legislation. And that's a story. And as I get older and read pieces like yours, I am overwhelmed by how much people remember lessons that are delivered by stories, fables, parables, jokes, things that rhyme, poems, songs, et cetera. And they're underutilized. They're considered cheesy a little bit. It's like a bad form when you can give a formal lecture in mathematics versus a story. That snake story I just told. I suspect a year from now, there might be some listeners who actually remember that, and there might even be some listeners who will see a different example and realize the snake story is the same set of unintended incentives. So I think stories and jokes are undervalued. Yeah, I think what that story does, at least, what does for me when I first heard it is it evokes this feeling of, oh, the way I first heard the story, there's two turns in it. The first turn is people start raising snakes and I go, oh, yeah, people would do that. I hadn't really thought through the implications of this, but yeah, if I was in this situation, it makes total sense to raise the snakes. And then the second turn in the story is, oh, no, we're paying people to raise snakes. We're not going to pay bounties on snakes anymore. And then people release the snakes into the wild. Yeah, of course they would do that. Now if I'm not going to pay for my snakes anymore, I'm just going to let them go again. And I think that feeling, that is to me what the vibe is. And I think the explicit knowledge of this is like a checklist thing where you say, make sure for every policy you check for unintended consequences. I think that's actually much less effective than this feeling of, I feel a little bit suspicious when we do things that there might be something weird that happens. I think that's actually the important thing that when you hear about policies that people want to put in place, you just get a little like, I don't know. And that is what encourages you to go looking for like, well, but that might cause this thing and this thing and this thing. I think that's the vibe at work rather than the explicit knowledge of the story. I don't think people even need to refer back to like, well, isn't this like the snakes and paying for them? I think it is internalizing this feeling of skepticism and almost queasiness that the world is very simple and you always get exactly the things that you are trying to pay for. That's the vibe to me. Yeah. And it's an aha moment. It's the and then what that economists often want to get people to imagine and start thinking about. I'm going to tell another story, if I might, and I'm probably going to get it wrong because I can't remember the details, but it doesn't matter. It's about a prisoner war camp or some kind of setting where there's guards and there's workers and every night or once a week maybe one of the workers comes to the front gate, he's going back to his outside the camp life and he's got a wheelbarrow with a tarp over it, and the guard's suspicious, what's this guy stealing? And he looks under the tarp, and he can't find anything. And they play this game for a couple of years to find the guards reassigned to another camp. And before he leaves, he goes to the prisoner or the worker in the prisoner work camp, and he says, I just had a suspicion that you're smuggling something out of the camp, and I've never been able to find it. Am I right? He says, yeah, I was smuggling something. What was it? He goes, wheelbarrows. So that, to me, is a metaphor for what we're talking about in the classroom. And, of course, it applies to econ talk. This weird experience of doing 900 plus hours of conversation with people. I think I'm smuggling out knowledge, but it turns out I'm smuggling wheelbarrows. People are learning other things from this than the content of the conversations that take place, which is very flattering, and I've embraced it. I think it's a beautiful thing. But what is the implication of that for being a faculty member in a normal economics or psychology department? If you're listening to this and you recognize this as a reality and a truth, how should it change the way you run your class? In one way is you could say, you should tell more stories. You should be more. But let's suppose that I really care about the vibe part of it. I don't want to react to your insight and say, I guess I better ask them to repeat it, the equations, more to their friends outside or the classroom. Right? Which is a classic memory trick. You should repeat things you want to retain. It works a little bit, maybe. I don't think it's a bad idea, actually. You have to do it three times. If it didn't work, it's because you didn't do it enough. So I don't know if any of that's true, but let's suppose you're faced with this reality. You're going to spend hours with this group of students. Should it change what you do? Or should just say, well, now that I can do about it, I think it should change what you do. So how it changes for me is I can best tell us through the example of how I tried to teach students the R programming language, which is like, I don't know any other programming languages, so maybe this is an especially counterintuitive one, but there's a real hump that you have to get over at the beginning, where you start to think like the programming language wants you to think. And students find this very difficult. And in a class that is meant to teach students the R programming language, obviously you have to spend some time doing the things. That's sort of multiple choice knowledge. It's not that we want anyone to memorize the commands and we test them on them later, but you do need some of that. So we do work on some of that. But the most important thing that I can get students to understand is that it's okay, that they are going to feel like it's stupid and pointless and Byzantine and Kafka esque, how they interact with this programming language. And that's fine because most students feel like something's gone wrong when they hit that wall, that they do something and it doesn't work, and they go, well, I'm not doing it right. This is a stupid. Why is it so dumb? And if I can get them to understand the vibe of it's okay to feel dumb. I've worked with this language for ten years, and I still feel dumb when I interact with it, that, in fact, you need to accept feeling dumb in order to interact with this language. Well, if I can show them that through the way that I interact with it, that I type stuff in and fail, and then I go, I just got to Google that. And to show that I'm not losing or passion for doing this as I'm interacting with it. And the students who pick up on that vibe, who come along with it, who go like, oh, this is a different way of learning for me than I'm used to. They're the ones who continue using the language afterward. They're the ones who actually learn it, the ones who try to master it in the way that they would master, like, multiplication tables of just memorization. They don't get anywhere. It doesn't submit to that kind of learning. So that's part of the difference. I project to them the vibe of, I'm pretty stupid at this, and that's fine. I get by doing this thing. I spend a lot of time on stack overflow. This might all be out of date now that you can just ask Chad GBT how to do your coding for you. But even there, it's like, look, you may get to the .1 day where you speak this fluently. That takes a long time. And to get there, you really have to use it all the time. You're probably not going to do that. What I would rather convey to you is this vibe of, it's all right. Not to know stuff. It's okay to look stuff up all the time, and only if you get that vibe will you actually get out of this language what it has to give you. So that is, I think, the difference for going for a vibes based approach. Yeah. And I think there's a profound implication of that, both for parents and teachers, which is, I think we already know this, but it's really hard to actually behave accordingly, which is that when your students ask you a question or a child asks you a question, a lot of times the right answer is not to tell them the right answer. And you write about this in the essay, they'll ask a question, how do I do that? I'm really frustrated. And you don't tell them, and you don't not tell them by saying, well, you're going to have to figure it out for yourself. It's part of the class. You just say, I don't remember that either. I usually just Google it. And there are probably times when you do remember it, but you want them to go through that. And so often, because we do not appreciate the lesson that you're conveying in this essay, we think the right way to educate is to make sure they know the answEr. So we tell them the answer and we write the essay for our kid because, not that they'll get a good grade, so they'll know what the right way is to write a good essay. And that's worse than a waste of time. Not only do they not learn something, they learn something that's not helpful, which is to give up or to seek a different source. And I think the implication also is very important in the era of chat GPT, as I think many colleges are, we're trying to figure out here at Shalem College. I don't want rules on chat GPT for our students because I don't want to enforce them. I don't even try to figure out how I could enforce them, but I do want them to believe that if they ask chat GPT to figure out what this poem means or this passage, they won't experience the full effect, because the goal is to figure out what the passage means. Part of the goal is to experience the struggle and the knowledge that comes from the Nth time, and that's hard. We don't live in an era where that kind of discipline and perseverance is generally rewarded. We make life easy for everybody as much as possible. So it's going to be an interesting time as we deal with this. Yeah, I think part of what implies to students that it's not okay to struggle is that we evaluate them. This is another essay I wrote about wanting to be a teacher, but they made me a cop, where if I try to tell students that it's okay to be stupid about this and to not know how it works and to Google stuff, and then six weeks later, I go, now's test day and laptops down. Just tell me all the things that you memorized. I was lying to them. Right? I'm not conveying the vibe that I actually wanted to convey. If it is true that you can struggle and fail, and the thing that you're supposed to figure out is how to figure out things, then I should create an environment where you are allowed to figure out things. And if I'm going to evaluate you, I have to figure out a way of evaluating you that evaluates your ability to figure out things. And I think that's sort of at ODs with the thing that it's trying to assess. Go ahead. So if you want people to figure stuff out, I don't think you give them a multiple choice question test at the end. I think that heavily implies to them that the vibe here is that knowledge is arbitrary and the point of learning is to satisfy my whims and to divine my intentions, to know the things that I am going to ask you later. And I think that is exactly the wrong life that we want to give people. Yeah, I used to do that pretty ruthlessly and relentlessly, actually. I used to tell my students that your job in this course is to learn how to think like I do. At the end of it, you might decide it's a bad way to think, but that's how you're going to be evaluated. And I'm not going to tell you what the assumptions you should make to help you answer a question. My questions are a little bit open ended, and the best answers are the ones I deem interesting, and you have to learn what that is, and that's really cruel, actually. It was hard, and a lot of people didn't like it, and I now older, understand that. Having said that, students who managed to get over that hump got a tool that many of them, I think, still use, which is deeply gratifying. Your remark about tricking them or seemingly misleading them reminds me of something else you wrote recently about science, and wouldn't it be nice to live not in a classroom where I tell you what I know about the subject, but where we explore a subject together? You called it science House. So you have a bunch of really smart people who hang out together and actually through conversation rather than lecturing, learn to, as the novices learn, get initiated into the experience of science and the so called experts convey that, but in a different way than they do in a classroom. It's not dissimilar from the stories that Ed Lehmer told. We'll put a link up to this episode, one of my all time favorites of how he helped a student understand something rather than telling it to her. So that's a lovely idea. It has no viability in today's world because students are buying a credential in most situations and we're providing that as educators and charging them to provide the credential, which is going to be a multiple choice exam that you cleared a hurdle of 95 or 90 or whatever it is, or 80, depending on the test, as opposed to. Again, I like to think what we try to do here at Shalom College. We're definitely a swimming against the tide. We're basically saying to people, come explore with us for a while and you'll grow from it and you'll end up making your country better because you'll be a better human being. You won't know necessarily as much as somebody who takes a multiple choice test that day of the exam, but ten years from now you'll be a different person. I think that's what education should be. It's clear that the model in most societies, most systems, is credentialing. And I think that is, I don't know if it's tragic or not, but it's not education. Something else? Yeah. Something that I've realized about the world is everybody is looking for someone else to do their homework for them. That is the point of a credential is I can't tell how good you are or I don't want to do the work that it would take to know if you have the skills necessary to do the thing that I want you to do, or I don't even understand the skills well enough to do this. I know if you are trying to get a programming job, they'll ask you to program, but if you're trying to get a managing job, they don't ask you to manage, right? Because they probably don't even know what it takes to manage well enough. And so what they're looking for is some signal that you know that and so they look well. Do you have a degree and where's it from and how good are the grades that you got when you went there? All of these things that are, I think really orthogonally related to whether you actually possess the traits that they want you to possess, and that actually assessing people takes a lot of work, work that no one is really willing to do. And so instead, we all want to outsource it to other people. And so you go pay $60,000 a year to get assessed, and then come to me and tell me what your assessment says. But the people doing the assessment, they're not doing the thing that you might hope that they would be doing. They're doing their own thing that their incentives lead them to do in their little world. Like when I'm teaching a class I don't care about later telling McKinsey or Goldman Sachs whether this person would be a good employee for them. I'm trying to teach them psychology. And so all of us are hoping that someone else in the chain is going to save us time, but no one really seems to do it, which is why I dream of this place where we come and work together and we have this freedom. You eventually can just do things that make it clear to people the skills that you have. Like, you can't fake asking a question about the world, collecting data on it, and writing it up in an accessible way. That if you can produce an interesting blog post about a study that you ran that anyone could read and understand, even someone who's not putting that much work into assessing, you can tell that you know what you're doing. Whereas if what you do is produce journal articles that obey all the norms of the field, and they try to be inaccessible to outsiders, unless you are an expert in that field, I don't know if you wrote a good economics paper or not. And so I'm just looking at like, well, I do know which journals are good. Is this in a good journal? Okay, then you must be a good practitioner of this. Which is why I have this hope that if you actually conveyed the vibes well, if you actually taught people well, they would be able to do things that make assessing them very easy. And the point wasn't ever to make them very accessible. The point was to do the things that we all wanted to do in the first place. That's my hope anyway. And I think part of that, of course, is that the skills that we want in an employee or a colleague are often difficult to measure. Just to take an example. I want a thoughtful person who can ask good questions. That's worth a lot to me as a friend. Forget as a scientific colleague, it covers a lot of ground for me. How do you know who that person is? Well, in real life, what you do is you have a lot of conversations with them and you figure out who's interesting and who isn't and spend your time accordingly. But it's very hard to assess managerial ability. It's very hard to assess integrity. It's very hard to assess a bunch of things. So we use screening and other types of forms of activity that. You're right, we outsource it, and we know it's crude, but it might be better than we're able to do. I think there's something else. I don't know if we'll find it today, but I think I've learned something profound from your essay about thinking about conversation. I'm not sure I've gotten to the sweet spot for thinking about education. And I think it's a lot more than simply how overcoming, say, an intellectual challenge makes you feel or the confidence you gain from that. Those things are not unimportant. But for something that we spend billions of dollars on publicly and privately education, it's interesting how little we've thought about these questions. At one point you say, I'd like to go to the literature. There isn't any on this question of vibe, feeling, emotion, the fact that those are not just accessible, but they're the first thing that comes to mind just without thinking about it. One of my favorite classes in college, I'm not going to say what the subject was, but I remember two things about it. It made sense. I loved that it fit together. And the second thing was that in office hours one time, the professor told me, get an article published, how excited he was. He lectured for hours. I don't remember any of his lectures, but I do remember that he was really proud of it. And then he confessed that after the third or fourth one, it's not that exciting. And kind of the thrill is gone. Gosh. Wow. Liberal arts universities will tell you that what you are doing there is learning how to learn, which sounds good, but then I don't think there's actually a strong theory about how the learning how to learn happens, that there's this trust that, yeah, you take a philosophy class and you take a math class and you take a biology class, and the emergent property of taking all those classes is you learn how to learn. But none of those individuals, I think, are on mission for teaching people how to learn. They're there to teach people biology. That's what's on the syllabus. And I think, in fact, the incentives are structured such that you often learn the opposite. What you learn is how to get good grades in these classes because that's what you're assessed on. So why would you learn anything else? That's the way that you make yourself legible to the university and to people afterward who are looking at your transcript. So what would it really take to teach people how to learn? I think it might involve letting go of assessment, and I think a lot of it would involve not just trusting that there's some emergent property that you get from taking many different classes, that you need to approach it in some different way. I think that's very important. I think that's a statement about the nature of the PhD experience and how when you become a teacher, you tend to teach what you were taught. If it's at the undergraduate level, you dumb down what you were taught at the graduate level, you don't think about that. Many of these students will never go on to graduate school. Maybe the only economics or psychology class they're going to take and therefore maybe should teach it differently. The idea that we might structure economics and biology and psychology and math as a regime of practice rather than filling up the bucket with facts and regularities, is alien to everything that our graduate education system does to the people we end up hiring as teachers. And that's a whole nother conversation. But you're right. What teachers do is they play in their silo, and the best ones, like your M M thrower, inspire students. And I'm sure many of the students in that class loved that class, even though they didn't become professional psychologists as you chose to do professional PhDs. But it requires a different kind of education. We have a member of our faculty here who told me his job in his class is to help our students become the best people they can be. Well, I didn't get trained in that at Chicago in my PhD program, but I don't think it should be alien to how I teach an undergraduate who's never going to be a PhD in economics and yet never thought about it until recently. Yeah, the class I taught most recently is negotiation. And this is a class where there's so much that we convey to students, I think, in the parts of the class that we don't think that much about what students do a lot is they do mock negotiations. And I think we transmit the vibe in what those negotiations are about. And really we think of those negotiations as just like it's really just a cover story for creating a situation where people can work on the concepts that we want them to work on. But the fact that we are doing a negotiation about buying a vineyard. Actually, that means something like we are conveying to students that that is the kind of negotiation that we expect them to encounter in the world. I think there's a reason why it's negotiation for a vineyard rather than negotiation for a parking lot. And those things mean different things. We are telling these students that we expect them to be upper class people who would buy vineyards, which in the case of Columbia Business School, I think maybe isn't inaccurate, but is a weird value to be conveying at the university level. And I think no one has ever really thought about what it meant that the negotiation is about a vineyard. They care a lot about which concepts we hit, and those do matter. But if we're really trying to make people into good people, we should care a lot about what the COVID story is, what the situation is that we are putting people in. And you're newly married, and much of marriage is about negotiation. And it's negotiation that has no price tags usually. There are some economists, maybe, but most human beings aren't negotiating with their spouses over. They're not haggling over price, they're haggling over responsibility. They're haggling over a variety of other things. And doing that as a full human being would seem like a very good skill. That's never taught, as far as I know. Maybe by some marriage counselors, but it's not in that class, and it belongs in there, it seems to me. Yeah, I think if we took seriously the mission of making people better people, I would have taught that class differently. That the guy who trained me how to teach negotiation did describe it as a process of making jerks into less jerks, which I do think is true. But I never felt like I was actually given free enough reign to do that. And maybe that's beyond the scope of what Columbia University thinks. It's able to do that. It requires staking a claim in some values. You can't just go like, well, some of you are going to go cut down rainforests, and some of you are going to go run hospitals. And these are the same thing. And that's all good as long as you give money to us later. I think you have to be willing to say, like, it is possible for you to go do jobs that we think are bad, and we would really prefer that you don't do them. I don't know. That's obviously opened a dangerous can of worms. But I do want to be able to talk to my students that there are bad actors in the world. And some of you could become them, right? Like these people come from somewhere. They go get MBAs. I want to prevent you from becoming a bad actor, and that's part of what could happen in this negotiation class, that I want you to use these skills for good. And so I want to put you in situations where perhaps you might be tempted to use them for bad. And the lesson is how to use them for good. It doesn't really happen. I try to tell them not to lie, and I try to put them in situations where lying actually sometimes ends up with worse outcomes, but it's difficult. And I didn't feel like I actually had legitimacy or the institutional mandate and support to do that. But you're a psychologist, so you could also teach them how to overcome their natural inclination to be a bad actor. In theory you could. I don't know if you actually could, but that'd be kind of cool. If they wanted, you could give them the tools if they wanted. They didn't want to be a bad actor. And maybe you're going to teach them R so they can use data to be even worse actor. Ours, pretty value neutral in theory. Negotiation is too, but of course it's not. It's part of a bigger picture. Yeah. I mean, the other lever that I had to pull right is in the way that I organized my class. And this is a way that I tried to convey the vibes that I thought would make people better people, which was, for one thing, trusting them and showing that I trusted them. That so many classes have these baroque policies for what happens if you don't come to class. And sometimes they're punitive. You have to come, or I'll take points away, or you have to get a doctor's note. And so I just said it is important to come to class. It's a very experiential class, and other people benefit from you being here, too. So please do come to math. It is part of your grade. If you're not going to be here, all you have to do is fill out this form that says you're not going to be here. And you can click this button that says, I have a good reason not to be here and I will trust you. And if you use this for nefarious purposes, all you're doing is stealing monopoly money. These points are made up. I really hope that you don't do it. I would be disappointed if you were. But I'm not going to police you because I think this is the way that humans should relate to one another. So that's how I choose to treat you because I would like to be treated like this as well. And I hope that that did a little bit to produce this vibe of like, oh, isn't, isn't it good when we trust one another? And yeah, actually, people can abuse systems, but wouldn't you rather be in a system that treated you well, that could be abused rather than you get policed just as much as the person who is trying to do the bad thing? And it turns out that the person stealing the point is like, they don't really do anything to you. Most of you are just going to get A's. In fact, I'm going to break the curve a little bit because I think the curve is dumb. That's what I tried to do. My guest today has been Adam Astriani. Adam, thanks for being part of EconTalk.
